# Name #

**ngx\_http\_upstream\_check\_module**

Add proactive health check for the upstream servers.

This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the `--add-module=modules/ngx_http_upstream_check_module` configuration parameter.

# Examples #

	http {
		upstream cluster1 {
			# simple round-robin
			server 192.168.0.1:80;
			server 192.168.0.2:80;

			check interval=3000 rise=2 fall=5 timeout=1000 type=http;
			check_http_send "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
			check_http_expect_alive http_2xx http_3xx;
		}

		upstream cluster2 {
			# simple round-robin
			server 192.168.0.3:80;
			server 192.168.0.4:80;

			check interval=3000 rise=2 fall=5 timeout=1000 type=http;
			check_keepalive_requests 100;
			check_http_send "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nHost: foo.bar.com\r\n\r\n";
			check_http_expect_alive http_2xx http_3xx;
		}

		server {
			listen 80;

			location /1 {
				proxy_pass http://cluster1;
			}

			location /2 {
				proxy_pass http://cluster2;
			}

			location /status {
				check_status;

				access_log   off;
				allow SOME.IP.ADD.RESS;
				deny all;
			}
		}
	}

# Directives #

## check ##

Syntax: **check** `interval=milliseconds [fall=count] [rise=count] [timeout=milliseconds] [default_down=true|false] [type=tcp|http|ssl_hello|mysql|ajp|send|udp] [port=check_port]`

Default: If the parameters are omitted, default values are: `interval=30000 fall=5 rise=2 timeout=1000 default_down=true type=tcp`

Context: `upstream` (both in `http` and in `stream`)

Add health check for the upstream servers.

In a `stream` upstream only the protocol-independent types are accepted: `tcp`, `ssl_hello`, `mysql`, `send` and `udp`. Configuring `http`, `fastcgi` or `ajp` there is a configuration error, and so is `udp` in an `http` upstream. See "Stream upstreams" below.

Passive health checking should not be enabled, as they may interfere. So do not use fail_timeout for the servers in the upstream context for which proactive health checking is enabled.

The parameters' meanings are:

* `interval`: the check request's interval time.
* `fall`(fall\_count): After fall\_count failure checks, the server is marked down.
* `rise`(rise\_count): After rise\_count successful checks, the server is marked up.
* `timeout`: the check request's timeout.
* `default_down`: specify initial state of backend server, default is down.
* `type`: the check protocol type:
 - `tcp`: a simple TCP socket connect and peek one byte.
 - `ssl_hello`: send a client SSL hello packet and receive the server SSL hello packet.
 - `http`: send a http request packet, receive and parse the http response to diagnose if the upstream server is alive.
 - `mysql`: connect to the mysql server, receive the greeting response to diagnose if the upstream server is alive.
 - `ajp`: send an AJP Cping packet, receive and parse the AJP Cpong response to diagnose if the upstream server is alive.
 - `send`: send the fixed byte string of `check_send` and look for `check_expect_response` in the reply. Protocol-independent, for health-checking a proprietary protocol this module knows nothing about.
 - `udp`: the datagram variant of `send`, `stream` only. See `check_send` below.
* `port`: specify the check port in the backend servers. It can be different with the original servers port. Default the port is 0 and it means the same as the original backend server. This option is added after tengine-1.4.0.

## check\_keepalive\_requests ##

Syntax: **check\_keepalive\_requests** `request_num`

Default: `1`

Context: `upstream`

The directive specifies the number of requests sent on a connection, the default vaule 1 indicates that tengine will certainly close the connection after a request.

This directive was first introduced in Tengine-2.0.0.

## check\_http\_send ##

Syntax: **check\_http\_send** `http_packet`

Default: `"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"`

Context: `upstream`

If the check type is http, the check function will send this http packet to the upstream server. Method "HEAD" is recommended for reducing traffic.

When persistant connection is used, a keep-alive request header should be added to the value of the directive, e.g. `"HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n"`.
In addition, in the case of "GET" method, size of the request uri should not be too large, make sure the transmission can be finished within an `interval`, otherwise the health check will deduce a conclusion that there is something wrong with the servers or the net. 

## check\_send ##

Syntax: **check\_send** `bytes`

Default: none, nothing is sent

Context: `upstream` (both in `http` and in `stream`)

The payload sent by the `send` and `udp` check types. Only valid for those types, and only after `check`.

On top of the `\r`, `\n`, `\t` and `\\` escapes the configuration parser already understands, `\xHH` is accepted, so a binary heartbeat can be spelled out:

    upstream redis {
        server 127.0.0.1:6379;

        check interval=3000 rise=2 fall=3 timeout=1000 type=send;
        check_send            "PING\r\n";
        check_expect_response "+PONG";
    }

For `type=udp` bear in mind that a datagram probe has no handshake: probing the port alone proves nothing, so the peer is judged only by whether a reply arrives before `timeout` expires. Configure a more generous `timeout` than for a TCP check. A closed UDP port is usually detected faster than a silent one, because the ICMP port unreachable it triggers fails the check immediately instead of waiting for the timeout.

## check\_expect\_response ##

Syntax: **check\_expect\_response** `bytes`

Default: none, any reply means the peer is alive

Context: `upstream` (both in `http` and in `stream`)

The byte string that must appear anywhere in the response for a `send` or `udp` check to succeed. Accepts the same escapes as `check_send`. Without it, receiving anything at all is enough.

If the expected bytes never arrive the check fails when `timeout` expires, so `timeout` is what bounds how long a wrong or missing answer takes to be noticed.

## check\_http\_expect\_alive ##

Syntax: **check\_http\_expect\_alive** `[ http_2xx | http_3xx | http_4xx | http_5xx ]`

Default: `http_2xx http_3xx`

Context: `upstream`

These status codes indicate the upstream server's http response is OK and the check response is successful.

## check\_shm\_size ##

Syntax: **check\_shm\_size** `size`

Default: `1M`

Context: `http`, `stream`

Default size is one megabytes. If you want to check thousands of servers, the shared memory may be not enough, you can enlarge it with this directive.

HTTP and stream upstreams share one zone. When the directive appears in both blocks, the larger of the two sizes is used.

## check\_status ##

Syntax: **check\_status** `[html|csv|json]`

Default: `check_status html`

Context: `location`

Display the status of checking servers. This directive should be used in the http block.

You can specify the default display format after Tengine-1.4.0. The formats can be `html`, `csv` or `json`. The default type is `html`. It also supports to specify the format by the request argument. Suppose your `check_status` location is '/status', the argument of `format` can change the display page's format. You can do like this:

    /status?format=html
    /status?format=csv
    /status?format=json

At present, you can fetch the list of servers with the same status by the argument of `status`. For example:

    /status?format=html&status=down
    /status?format=csv&status=up

The last column, `Protocol`, tells whether the peer was registered by an `http` or a `stream` upstream. It is reported last in every format (a trailing field in CSV, a trailing member in JSON, an extra label in the prometheus output), so consumers that parse the older output by position keep working.

# Stream upstreams #

Health checks are also available for `stream` upstreams, which is where nginx otherwise only offers passive checking (`max_fails` / `fail_timeout`) -- a peer is dropped only after live traffic has already failed against it.

    stream {
        upstream tcp_cluster {
            server 192.168.0.1:3306;
            server 192.168.0.2:3306;

            check interval=3000 rise=2 fall=5 timeout=1000 type=tcp;
        }

        server {
            listen 3306;
            proxy_pass tcp_cluster;
        }
    }

    http {
        server {
            listen 80;

            # renders the status of the stream peers above as well
            location /status {
                check_status;

                access_log   off;
                allow SOME.IP.ADD.RESS;
                deny all;
            }
        }
    }

A peer marked down is skipped by every stream load balancing method: round-robin, `hash`, `least_conn`, `random` and `least_time`.

A UDP upstream is checked with `type=udp`:

    stream {
        upstream dns_cluster {
            server 192.168.0.1:53;
            server 192.168.0.2:53;

            check interval=3000 rise=2 fall=3 timeout=2000 type=udp;
            check_send            "\x00\x01\x01\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07example\x03com\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01";
            check_expect_response "\x00\x01";
        }

        server {
            listen     53 udp;
            proxy_pass dns_cluster;
        }
    }

Things to be aware of:

* Only the protocol-independent check types are accepted: `tcp`, `ssl_hello`, `mysql`, `send` and `udp`. `http`, `fastcgi` and `ajp` are rejected as a configuration error. `udp` in turn is only available here, not in `http`.
* `check_status` is an HTTP location handler and can only be configured in `http`. A deployment consisting of a `stream` block alone needs an `http` server of its own to render the page; the page then lists peers of both kinds.
* `check_keepalive_requests`, `check_http_send`, `check_http_expect_alive` and `check_fastcgi_param` are HTTP-only and are not available in `stream`.
* Peers resolved at run time (`server example.com:3306 resolve;`) take no part in health checking, on either side: they have no address to probe when the configuration is parsed.
* The `stream` module must be built statically. `--with-stream=dynamic` together with this addon is rejected at configure time, because the stream module shares the health-check core with the statically linked HTTP one.
